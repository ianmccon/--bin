Mark's Script Collection
========================

What is this?
-------------

This is just a collection of small useful scripts that make working with the command line easier for me.

To make the most of these scripts, install them on every new computer that you work on. They will help to get you up and running with all your defaults in place.

How do I install this?
----------------------
Ensure that ~/bin is part of your path and
run <pre><code>git checkout git://github.com/markmcconachie/--bin.git ~/bin </code></pre>

How do I use this?
------------------

### Git

Edit settings in ~/bin/config-git to reflect your desired git settings and run
<pre><code>config-git</code></pre>
